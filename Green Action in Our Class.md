As a student in Class 1, Grade 12 at Red Star High School, we took part in a tree-planting mission on April 12th in response to the national call for greening our homeland. Our initiative aimed to contribute to environmental sustainability and have a positive impact on the surroundings.

Upon reaching school, we convened for a quick assembly where Mr. Cat, our teacher, outlined the essential tasks. Afterward, we moved to a suburban area chosen for our tree-planting activity. Our teacher invited forestry experts to share insights into sapling types and proper planting techniques. Divided into groups, we actively engaged in the hands-on experience of planting trees.
Equipped with shovels and saplings, our groups faced the challenge of digging proper holes in the soil. It was harder than expected, especially with the presence of rocks and the hard ground. We quickly realized the importance of teamwork, as we assisted each other in overcoming these obstacles.
It proved to be another challenge to place the saplings in the holes exactly. Ensuring the right depth and securing them in the soil required precision. Some of us initially struggled to position the saplings correctly, but with guidance from the experts and collaboration within our groups, we soon got the hang of it.
Despite the challenges, the hands-on nature of the activity taught us valuable lessons. We learned the significance of adaptability and problem-solving. The experience also fostered a sense of shared responsibility and collaboration among us, as we worked together to overcome difficulties encountered during the tree-planting process. 

The activity finished for just a little time, but we were all happy. Documenting our progress with photographs and videos, we captured not only the challenges we faced but also the successful moments. It gave us both the joy of success and also the importance of teamwork in achieving a common goal. I think I will never forget it.
